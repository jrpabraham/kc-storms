developing theory

distributed lag model
	literature on long term impacts of typhoons
	determining optimal lag length
		AIC/BIC criteria*
		4-5 years lag
	how do we deal with collinearity (Almon distributed lag model)

inconsistent standard errors and autocorrelation of outcomes
	clustering SEs such that SEs are independent between groups
	at what strata? Labonne uses municipal level clusters
		at least in the muni level
		barangay year level because hit at different time periods
	collapsing into two period analysis
	Labonne uses HH/mun FE
	*just try it out

analysis
	discuss significant outcome variables
	FIES data

inconsistent barangay coding
taking the average, taking the max, taking the sum
modeling 2009
descriptive statistics:
	compare outcomes by year (income, services, assembly)
	compare storms by year
	distribution of storms
	distribution over treatment
	distribution of project types
