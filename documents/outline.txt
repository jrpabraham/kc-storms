background and issue
	economic and human losses due to natural disasters in developing countries is well reported
	it is important to talk about ex ante disaster resilience 
	there is background on the effect of aid and physical infrastructure on resilience
	what is there about institutions?
		better governance might mean better provision of public goods
		it also might take strong centralized government to handle well

research question and contribution of the paper
	what effect does more inclusive institutions have on disaster preparedness
	H: does CDD intervention have an effect on outcomes after a disaster?
	causal channels: CDD >  > resilience
	value in randomization to determine causal influence
	looking at the issue through the household rather than aggregate level
	there are no studies thusfar on CDD intervention of covariate shock
	"let alone"

description of the intervention
	direct program outcomes and deliverables

data
	summary statistics
	geographic distribution
	
empirical strategy
	is there a structural form for this relationship?
	reduced form regression specification
	difference in difference
